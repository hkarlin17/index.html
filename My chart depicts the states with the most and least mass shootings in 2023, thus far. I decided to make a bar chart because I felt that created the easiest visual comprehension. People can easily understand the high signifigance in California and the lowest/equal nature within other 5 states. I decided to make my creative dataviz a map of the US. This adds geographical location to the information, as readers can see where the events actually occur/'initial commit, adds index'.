My chart depicts the states with the most and least mass shootings in 2023, thus far. I decided to make a bar chart because I felt that created the easiest visual comprehension. People can easily understand the high signifigance in California and the lowest/equal nature within other 5 states. I decided to make my creative dataviz a map of the US. This adds geographical location to the information, as readers can see where the events actually occur/how far or close they are. Looking back at it, if I would change something, I would try to come up with another method for creative dataviz. I feel like I could have created a more impactful image.
